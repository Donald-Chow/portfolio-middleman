- name: SmartVacay
  description: Final project for Le Wagon Batch 1190 Web Development course. This Web App allows user to create an itinerary for their trip with a single click of a button.
  description2: SmartVacay uses the Google Places API to fetch point of interest information after you've created a trip by entering the location and dates. The points of interest generated are based on the trip location, but the search function can also search for locations in other areas, allowing you to explore additional cities during your trip. By adding your desired locations to your wishlist, the app will know which places you want to visit on your trip.
  description3: When you generate the itinerary, SmartVacay takes into account the locations of your saved points of interest and groups them into logical days for your trip, minimizing the need to travel long distances between points of interest each day. Lastly, SmartVacay updates the travel duration needed based on the itinerary, allowing you to edit it as you see fit and providing information about the distance to each location immediately.

  description3: After logging in you will be greeted by the groups page, where you can create a dining group with your friends. You can also go to the explore page where you can browse restaurants where the app uses Google API to fetch for POI and add that to a favorites list. In your group, by starting a vote session with a favorites list of your choice. Instead of choosing the ultimate food location, simply decide 'yes' or 'no' for a restaurant shown on the screen. Once there is a restaurant where everyone wants to go app will tell you where the group has decided to go once the votes are in. A Bot user has been added that will vote automatically in V 0.2 Beta.
